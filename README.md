# Genesis

REST API architecture based on the main objective of Hexagonal Architecture: to isolate business logic from external dependencies.

## Architecture

- We use domain models as an example of design. Using domain models is not necessary if you are doing a small project, instead use the persistence models generated by `sqlc` library.

- We did not use ports (interfaces) of Hexagonal Architecture because in Go it's not idiomatic have fat interfaces (with many methods), nor were small interfaces possible.

- There are three library implementations for working with Postgres: `pq`, `pgx`, and `sqlc`. For now, the project uses `pgx`, but it will be switched to `sqlc`.

## Run with Postgres service

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/adrianolmedo/genesis.git
$ cp .env.example .env
$ docker-compose up -d --build postgres
```

**Up application service:**

```bash
$ task genrsa
$ task swagger
$ docker-compose up -d --build app
```
